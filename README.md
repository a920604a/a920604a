### :seedling: &nbsp; About Me

- :house: &nbsp; From **Taiwan** TW: and currently based in **Taipei, Taiwan**
- :speech_balloon: &nbsp; Talk to me about **Full Stack**, **Docker** and **Data Engineer**

I built a GitHub Data Analytics Pipeline leveraging GCP, Airflow, and BigQuery to automate the processing of GitHub Watch events and deliver real-time insights into open-source trends and developer engagement via a Streamlit dashboard.

I built a clothing recommendation platform that integrates web scraping, ETL, Redis caching, a FastAPI backend, and a React frontend to provide outfit suggestions based on location styles, color palettes, and gender filters.

I built a full MLOps pipeline for stock price prediction, featuring automated ETL, model training, experiment tracking, real-time inference, monitoring, and CI/CD‚Äîpowered by FastAPI, Prefect, MLflow, and Grafana on a Dockerized infrastructure.
